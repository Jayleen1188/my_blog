Hello everyone!

My name is Jayleen Sanchez and I am a undergraduate student at Dominican University. I am majoring in Biology and minoring in Chemistry with a pre-med concentration.

A little more about me is that I am very instrested in education and how it can affect mental health and or neurological disorders. Whenever I get the chance to research a topic these are my top go-to's.

Aside from scholarly things a fun fact about me is that I am an ambivert which I think is intresting. I tend to be more on the introvert side but when the occasion arrises I tend to become an extrovert. This comes in very useful when I am in a group with new people and help break the ice between all of us!

library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = hwy, y = cyl)) + geom_point()
