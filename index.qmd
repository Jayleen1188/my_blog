Hello Everyone!

Welcome to my website showing off my R portfolio. I will be showcasing my findings on how relationships with instructors, family or friends (support group), and academic work load influence your stress levels. My name is Jayleen Sanchez and I am a undergraduate student at Dominican University. I am majoring in Biology and minoring in Chemistry with a pre-med concentration.

I created this website as part of a course at Dominican university. It was created with R and Quarto in RStudio. My interests in neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer's and dementia, are my main focus as I work through this project and being to analyze data.
